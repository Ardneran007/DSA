Tree Traversal
Tree Traversal is basically going through every node(key) exactly once.
In this video we briefly discuss:
Types of Tree Traversal i.e.
 Breadth-First Search(BFS) 
 Line wise printing
 Depth First Search(DFS).
 {we need to do three things 1.transverse root 2. transverse left subtree 3. transverse right subtree}
 3! combiations->6 out of which we take the 3 famous transversals
we take 3 combinations in which left comes b4 right
Inorder    Left Root Right 
preorder   Root Left right    
postorder  Left Right Root
