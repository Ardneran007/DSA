is to keep height in check ie keep heigth as theta(logn)
heights depends on how u insert keys
---------------------------------------------------------------
if u know the keys to be inserted then first sort
it make its middle as root and middle of left oart as root of 
left subtree and so on.....
---------------------------------------------------------------
How to keep it balanced when insertion and 
deletion occurs?
Do some extra work while inserting  and deletion like while inserting
if u releazie balnce is not there then RESTRUCTURE the BST

ROTATION->Way to restructure the BST without violating BST
Rotating is O(1) operation
this restructuring is of two t ypes
1.right rotation
2.left rotation
//check the diagram for more understanding
------------------------------------------------------------------
Examples of self Balancing RED BLACK trees
1.AVL trees(very strict in terms of height)
2.Red Black Trees(loose in terms of balance) so the advantage is 
it causes less restructuring while inserting and deleting
in general RedBlacktrees are used more

MAPS AND SETS USE RED BLACK TREES
