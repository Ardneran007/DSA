1.It is BST
2.It is height balanced RULE(The differenece b/w left and 
right hgts does not exceeds one)
BALANCED FACTOR=mod(lh-rh)
BAlancde factor<=1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operations
1.search is same 
insertion and deletion are unbalanced
2.insert Algo
    a.perform normal BST insert
    b.traverse all the ancestors of the newly inserted node from node to root**(VIMP)
    c.if find an unbalanced node check for any of the causes
        1.LEFT LEFT     Single Rotation
        2.RIGHT RIGHT   Single Rotation
        3.LEFT RIGHT    Double Rotation
        4.RIGHT LEFT    Double Rotation
VIMP->//check the diagram for better understanding

height of AVL treesh<clog(n+2) + b
    c~1.44//very small for red black it is higher
    b~-1.3277
SO time taken for Search is logn
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rotations are done on 3 Nodes
