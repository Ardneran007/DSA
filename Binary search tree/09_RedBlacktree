AVL Tree is very strict ie height diff bw left and right
tree is less than 1 but RED BLACK TREE is very strict
------------------------------------------------------
Advantage of being loose->less reconstruction
Disadvantage->height may become high which may cause search costly
-------------------------------------------------------
definitionof RED BLACK TREES
1.Every Node is either Red or Black
2.Root is always Black
IMP POINTS which make tree as balanced
3.No two consecutive REDs
4.No of black tree to every node to all of descendant leave should 
be same
----------------------------------------------------------
Number of NOdes on the path from node to itsfarthest descendant leaf
should not be more than twice than the numner of NOdes on path to itsclosest descendant leaf

so insertions and deletion sare faster here 
in insertion we avoid the reconstructio nby switching colours 
use by SET and Maps
