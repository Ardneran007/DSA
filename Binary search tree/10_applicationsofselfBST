1.TO maintain sorted stream of data
2.To implement doubly endedpriority queue
3.TO solve problems like    
    a.COunt smaller/greater in a stream
    eg while selling online count elements sold below this price
    b.Floor/ceil/Floor?greater/smaller in a stream

---------------------------------------------------------------
TIP-
if there is only search insert delete or a subset of it
THEN USE HASH TABLE  as O(1) 

but if subset of search insert delete +(maintain data in sorted form)/(count smaller greater)(floor ceil )
THEN USE TREES
