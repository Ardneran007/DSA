/*
1.For every Node,keys in left side are smaller
than keys in right side
2.All keys are typically considered as distinct
3.It is a linkeddata structure
4.Implemented in c++ as map, Linkedlist,set

disadvantage->not cash friendly

Most of the operations of BInary search tree like search
insert delete variations of closet(finding floor,ceiling
,greater value) etc are O(h) h->height of binary search tree

so
HEIGHT OF BST MATTERS A LOT
but if BST is a balance done then every oerations become O(logn)
so BST must be balanced
