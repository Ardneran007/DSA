 Binary Heap
1.Used in heapsor
2.Used to implement priority queue
3.Two types
    a.Min heap(Highest Priority item is assigned lowest value)
    b.Max heap(Highest Priority item is assigned highest value)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Binary heap is a complete Binary Tree(stored as a array)
complete Binary tree is a tree where al Nodes are filleed and even if last level 
is Not filled completely it must not have any gaps ie it must have Nodes from
left to right

we want to store Binary heap as an array so 
//0th indexing
left(i)=2*i+1
right(i)=2*i+2
parent=floor(i-1/2)
Maximum Nodes at Height h(where  h is zero at bottom )=upperbound(n/pow(2,h+1))
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Min Heap
    1.Complete Binary Tree
    2.Every node has value smaller than its descendants(root is smaller than all its below Node)
Min Heap is internally represented as an array
