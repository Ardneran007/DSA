1.Cycle detection
2.Topological Sorting(Particularly useful for dependency graph ie when we have depedency on jobs and we want to schedule the jobs)
//ex of Topological SOrt is Makefile Utility(here we use dependency about the fileto be compilled)
//we specify that this file should be compilled aftre this file and so on

3.Strongly connceted components
4.SOLVING PROBLEMS LIKE MAZE (DFS is always preffered over BFS)
5.Path finding(DFS is natural for printing the path)
ie in th erecursion call stack there are all the edge that are on the 
path we just need to print
