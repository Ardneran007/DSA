Advantage of BFS->
    Always find a shortest path from source to all other vertices
1.shortest path in an unweighted graph
2.Crawlers in search Engine
3.Peer to Peer Networks
4.Social Networking search 
5.In garbage collection (Cheery's Ago)
6.Cycle detection
7.Fond Fulkerson Algorithm
8.Broadcasting
9.Bipartite**(IMP) lec26 aplications of BFS

if a graph has a odd cycle then it cannot be a Bipartite
